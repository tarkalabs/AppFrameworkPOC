# AppFrameworkPOC
This is the demo application that includes the framework 'DynamicCoreDataFrameworkPOC'

This application accesses the Core Data model inside the linked 'DynamicCoreDataFrameworkPOC' framework and adds entries to it as if it were part of the application itself, this way a dynamic framework can be shared across applications.
